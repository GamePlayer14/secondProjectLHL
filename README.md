# Final-Project-Statistical-Modelling-with-Python

## Project/Goals
I was assigned to gather data and make a linear regression model out of said data.

## Process
### first I gathered all the required data I needed from citybikes and foursquare
### then I used sklearn to make a linear model out of the data

## Results
I didnt have enough data, so I didn't get much of a model. 

## Challenges 
near the beginning, I was accidentally using the citybikes api 300 times in 1 session, so I was limited on what work I could do in a day. Later, I had so little data that I could barely get any model out of it.

## Future Goals
I would use yelp as well and see if they have a place to get other types of data like ratings, as foursquare didnt have that, at least not in Abu Dhabi.
