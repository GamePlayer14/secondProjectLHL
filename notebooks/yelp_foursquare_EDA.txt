Send a request to Foursquare with a small radius (1000m) for all the bike stations in your city of choice.

  dfa = []
  for x in range(len(df0)):
      url = "https://api.foursquare.com/v3/places/search?query=restaurant%20bar&ll={}%2C{}&limit=50".format(df0['latitude'][x],df0['longitude'][x])
      
      headers = {
          "accept": "application/json",
          "Authorization": "fsq34bQtxg6asQgePHYMhp2Sfm5LXoTJPoduCEq3rxhgccg="
      }
      
      response = requests.get(url, headers=headers)
  
      print(response)
      
      dfa.append(response.json())

Parse through the response to get the POI (such as restaurants, bars, etc) details you want (ratings, name, location, etc)
  
  bigList = []
  for item in dfa:
      smallList = []
      for block in item['results']:
          try:
              info = [block['categories'][0]['name'],block['distance']]
          except Exception as e:
              info = ''
          smallList.append(info)
      bigList.append(smallList)

Put your parsed results into a DataFrame

  df = pd.DataFrame(bigList)
